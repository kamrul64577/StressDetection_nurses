# StressDetection_nurses

This project aims to detect stress levels in nurses using wearable physiological sensors. The ability to continuously monitor physiological variables through wearable technology has opened new avenues for early stress detection, contributing to improved health management and reduced harmful effects of prolonged stress exposure.
