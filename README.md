# StressDetection_nurses

This project aims to detect stress levels in nurses using wearable physiological sensors. The ability to continuously monitor physiological variables through wearable technology has opened new avenues for early stress detection, contributing to improved health management and reduced harmful effects of prolonged stress exposure.

*Data Preparation: Download the dataset from [(https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5hqbzkh6f)] and place it in the data directory.(Unzip all of folders after download)

*Exploring the Code: Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the notebooks directory.

*Run the Code: Open the notebook corresponding to your choice of files.

*Execute the Cells: Run each cell in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, build the model, and evaluate its performance.

A survey result spreadsheet provides each nurse's stress level, ID, time, and date of signal collection.
